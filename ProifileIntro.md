I am a dedicated STEAM researcher curious about nanoscience, nanofabrication, nanotechnology, material science, and physics. With over six years of extended hands-on research experience, I have expertise in the attractive nanotechnology domain, constantly stretching the limitations of what is attainable in this rapidly growing field and other emerging domains. My cutting-edge research and development journey has helped me to learn nanofabrication, encompassing semiconductor fab, optical spectroscopy, and cleanroom operations. I believe in developing new ideas and working together as a team. My problem-solving approach is strongly reinforced by reasoning and applying first principles, helping me solve complex problems and provide practical solutions. I have diverse skill set including problem-solving, analytical thinking, communication, critical thinking, machine learning, statistics, organization, teamwork, nanofabrication, semiconductor fabrication, lithography, metrology, characterization techniques, photonics, visual studio, quantum materials, K-Layout, 3D CAD, GitHub, device making, cleanroom operations (ISO - 7,6,5), transport measurements, deposition techniques, surface science, coating techniques, spectroscopy techniques, microscopic techniques, optics, cryogenics, research and development, python, 3D illustration, presentations, writings, grant writing, data science, data analysis, MATLAB, six-sigma, and instruments operations. As an enthusiastic lifelong learner, I am continuously learning to expand my knowledge and skills. I am particularly interested in exploring new advances in nanotechnology, photonics, semiconductor technology, physics, and material science, as well as their potential to drive innovation and progress across various industries.
